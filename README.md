* At least one class that defines an interface.
* Two examples of polymorphim.
* One example of data coupling.
* One example of stamp coupling.

## Important Keywords:
1. Base Class
2. Inheritance
3. Interface
4. Polymorphim
5. Data Coupling
6. Stamp coupling

## Notes:
You can find comments in code to help you with complex meanings

There are two logic in this code:
1. Inheritance From Super Class.. (extends)
  - Super Class is (Pet Class)
