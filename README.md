** Please visit the (HW3_Animal_Example) Folder It is with full comments & the way 2 is better.

## Question:
Design a few classes which relate to a one concept as follows:
* At least two classes that define an inheritance relation from a base class. The base class could be an interface or abstract class.
* At least one class that defines an interface.
* Two examples of polymorphim.
* One example of data coupling.
* One example of stamp coupling.

## Important Keywords:
1. Base Class
2. Inheritance
3. Interface
4. Polymorphim
5. Data Coupling
6. Stamp coupling
7. Main file to run code

## Notes:
You can find comments in code to help you with complex meanings

There are two logic in this code:
1. Inheritance from Interface (implements)
    - Animal_Interface is the Interface.
    - Classes (Cat & Dog) are implements From the Interface (Animal_Interface)
    - Class (Pet_Friend) contain Data & Stamp Coupling examples.
    - Main Class is (HW3_Animal_Example)

2. Inheritance From Super Class.. (extends)
    - Super Class is (Pets Class)
    - Child Class is (Bird Class)
    - Class Bird inheritance from Super class Pets.
    - Class Pets implement from Animal_Interface Interface.
    - Main Class is (HW3_Animal_Example)
